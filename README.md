how i built it :
I created a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS as part of my web development internship project. First, I set up a basic project structure with two files: index.html for content and style.css for styling.

I began by building the HTML5 structure, which included a header with a logo and navigation links. Then, I designed a hero section with a heading, short description, and a call-to-action button to engage users.

For layout, I used CSS Flexbox to center and space elements properly. I applied custom styles to enhance visual appeal, including a gradient background, styled buttons, and hover effects. To ensure the website looked good on all devices, I implemented media queries for responsive behavior, such as collapsing the navigation on smaller screens.
